# Python-Temperature-Converter
This project will convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa in a GUI that is accessible and easy to use.
This was my first experience creating a GUI using python and it was really interesting learning new concepts such as Tkinter, binding, buttons, colour, tooltip widgets, etc.
